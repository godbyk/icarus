Since the beginning of time humans have watched birds soar through the air and have dreamed of doing the same.  However, the laws of physics have conspired to make that dream difficult, if not impossible, for a single human under his or her own power.  Fortunately, we are not constrained by physical law in virtual worlds so we can come close to fulfilling this dream for many.  Our primary objective for this project is to allow a person to navigate a virtual world as if they are flying by flapping their arms like wings.  A secondary objective for this project is to minimize the equipment the user must interacts with in order to experience self-powered flight.  Ideally the user will enter a virtual reality CAVE, start the program and fly.  There are some technological hurdles that may keep us from this ideal but we are sure we can come very close.

There are many possible benefits to this project---the most obvious being the ``cool factor.''  Another is the incorporation of physical activity into a traditionally passive activity like playing video games, in fact, many who have flown have commented on how tiring it is.  Also, this project has allowed us to hone the skills learned in HCI~575x.
