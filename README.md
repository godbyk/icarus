Icarus
======

Since the beginning of time humans have watched birds soar through the air and have dreamed of doing the same. However, the laws of physics have conspired to make that dream difficult, if not impossible, for a single human under his or her own power. Fortunately, we are not constrained by physical law in virtual worlds so we can come close to fulfilling this dream for many. Our primary objective for this project is to allow a person to navigate a virtual world as if they are flying by flapping their arms like wings. A secondary objective for this project is to minimize the equipment the user must interacts with in order to experience self-powered flight. Ideally the user will enter a virtual reality CAVE, start the program and fly.

In this repository, you will find:

 * the Icarus source code ([`src`](src)),
 * the final report of our work ([`doc/final-report`](doc/final-report)),
 * our project presentation ([`doc/presentation`](doc/presentation)), and
 * our project proposal ([`doc/proposal`](doc/proposal)).
